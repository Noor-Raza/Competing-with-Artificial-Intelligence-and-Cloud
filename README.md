## Project Overview
This repository contains my final project for the **Competing with Artificial Intelligence and Cloud** course at ESADE.  
The project — **ESADE Navigator** — is a **custom GPT-based solution** designed to help students seamlessly integrate into academic, social, and administrative life.  

---

## Problem & Solution
**Problem:**  
ESADE students face challenges managing complex administrative, academic, and logistical tasks (e.g., visas, housing, course planning). These often lead to confusion, missed deadlines, and inefficiency.  

**Solution:**  
ESADE Navigator uses **Generative AI** and **cloud-based task automation** to:  
- Provide **step-by-step guidance** for visas, housing, and academic planning.  
- Automate **task creation & deadline management** using Zapier integration.  
- Offer personalized, empathetic, and structured support based on student profiles.  

---

## Key Features
- **Documentation Assistance**  
  Visa requirements, NIE/TIE application, empadronamiento, medical insurance.  
- **Housing Support**  
  ESADE-recommended housing options, contract guidance, local rental rules.  
- **Academic Year Planning**  
  Course bidding, electives, skill seminars, study tours, academic deadlines.  
- **Task Automation**  
  Converts advice into actionable tasks with deadlines (e.g., *“Apply for NIE by [date]”*) and syncs to task managers via Zapier.  

---

## Technology Stack
- **GPT-based Assistant** — for natural language guidance.  
- **Zapier API Integration** — automating task creation and tracking.  
- **Cloud Resources** — scalable student-specific data handling.  

---

## Project Phases
1. **Ideation** — Identified core student pain points (documentation, housing, academic planning).  
2. **Planning** — Defined scope, mapped workflows, structured support.  
3. **Data Collection** — Curated ESADE resources (PDF guides, handbooks, deadlines).  
4. **Development** — Built core GPT interaction flows and Zapier task automation.  
5. **Testing** — Validated with simulated student scenarios and refined accuracy.  
6. **Deployment (pre-final)** — Ready for integration pending approvals.  

---

## Testing & Evaluation
- Scenario-based validation for documentation, housing, and academic workflows.  
- Iterative refinements to ensure accuracy, compliance, and usability.  
- Verified that automated task lists aligned with ESADE deadlines and regulations.  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied **AI + Cloud concepts** to design a scalable solution.  
- Learned practical **API integration** (Zapier) for automation.  
- Explored the **“Wow” effect** of combining GPT with task automation for real impact.
